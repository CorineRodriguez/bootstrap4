Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Let's have a little bit of fun today. There he comes. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.

We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. We'll put a ha</p>
